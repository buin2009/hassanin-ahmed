Good software is as much about simplification as it is about anything.

Over the past 45 days, I’ve been working on a rewrite of our question analysis software, Penamera and I’ve learned a lot more about simplification than I did writing it the first time around. Simplifications in key areas like UI design, user experience (UX), clicks per action and most importantly simpler code.

If your code stretches out line after line, something isn’t right. If it has too many if statements and conditions, maybe you should Write, read and refactor until it is simple enough to understand. Some of the best authors and poets use simple and clear language. You should too.

However, keep in mind that you shouldn’t refactor too much, too early and don’t get obsessed with optimisation. It can be a waste of time. Wrapping up and launching should be your first priority.

My favourite thing about software development is the ability to learn and re-learn every single day. Keep it simple.
